https://github.com/hemanitekwani/projects/blob/main/Breast_cancer.py
This repository contains code for a machine learning project focused on breast cancer diagnosis. The goal of this project is to predict whether a breast cancer diagnosis is malignant or benign based on various features using machine learning techniques.

Dataset
The breast cancer dataset used in this project is loaded from a CSV file named breast-cancer.csv. The dataset contains information about various features related to breast cancer tumors.

Features
The features used for prediction are extracted from the dataset by dropping the 'diagnosis' column, which represents the target variable. The remaining features include information about the characteristics of the tumors.

Preprocessing
Before training the machine learning model, the dataset is preprocessed in the following steps:

Data Loading: The dataset is loaded using the Pandas library.
Data Exploration: Basic information about the dataset is displayed, including its shape and summary statistics.
Handling Missing Values: Any missing values in the dataset are identified and handled if necessary.
Data Splitting: The dataset is split into training and testing sets using a test size of 20% and a random state of 42.
Model Training
A Logistic Regression model is used to predict breast cancer diagnosis. The following steps are taken in model training:

Model Initialization: An instance of the LogisticRegression model is created.
Model Fitting: The model is trained on the training data (features and corresponding target).
Training Accuracy: The accuracy of the model on the training data is calculated and displayed.
Testing Accuracy: The accuracy of the model on the testing data is calculated and displayed.
Evaluation
The accuracy of the trained model is evaluated using both the training and testing datasets. The accuracy score is calculated using the accuracy_score function from the scikit-learn library. The accuracy score provides insight into how well the model is performing in terms of correctly predicting breast cancer diagnoses.

Dependencies
The following libraries are used in this project:

NumPy
Pandas
scikit-learn (sklearn)
joblib



https://github.com/hemanitekwani/projects/blob/main/facemesh.py
This repository contains code for a real-time face mesh detection application using the OpenCV and MediaPipe libraries. The application captures video from the default camera (usually the webcam), processes each frame, and detects facial landmarks using the MediaPipe FaceMesh module. Detected landmarks are then visualized on the video frame in real-time.



This repository contains code for a fake news detection project using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The project aims to classify news articles as either real or fake based on their content. The implementation includes data preprocessing, feature extraction using TF-IDF vectorization, and training a Logistic Regression model for classification.

Dataset
The project uses a subset of a news dataset containing information such as authors, titles, and labels (real or fake) for various news articles. The dataset is loaded from a CSV file named train.csv.

Data Preprocessing
The following data preprocessing steps are performed:

Data Loading: The dataset is loaded using Pandas.
Handling Missing Values: Any missing values in the dataset are filled to ensure consistent data.
Feature Creation: A new feature, 'content', is created by combining the 'author' and 'title' columns.
Text Preprocessing: The 'content' feature is processed to remove non-alphabetic characters, convert text to lowercase, tokenize, perform stemming using the Porter Stemmer, and remove stopwords.
Feature Extraction
TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorization is used to convert the processed text into numerical features that can be used by machine learning models. The TfidfVectorizer from scikit-learn is used to transform the preprocessed text data.

Model Training and Evaluation
A Logistic Regression model is trained on the TF-IDF features. The following steps are performed:

Data Splitting: The dataset is split into training and testing sets.
Model Initialization and Training: A Logistic Regression model is initialized and trained on the training data.
Accuracy Calculation: The accuracy of the model is calculated on both the training and testing data.
